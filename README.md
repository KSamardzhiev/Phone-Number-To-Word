----------


Telephones typically have letters on their buttons. Specifically:

This provides a mapping between the phone number digits and the English letters. The mapping allows some telephone numbers to be represented as English words. For example, the telephone number 966 337 3855 is equivalent to the word ***"WONDERFUL"***. Obviously the latter is much easier to remember.

We need to make a program which is given a telephone number and returns the English words it corresponds to (if any).

#Additional task

The mapping above allows some telephone number to be represented as English phrases too (not only one word). For example,  the telephone number 4 264 663 is equivalent to the word ***"I AM GOOD"***.
